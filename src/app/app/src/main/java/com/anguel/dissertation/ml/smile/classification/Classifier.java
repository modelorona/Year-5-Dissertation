/**
 * A classifier assigns an input object into one of a given number of categories.
 * The input object is formally termed an instance, and the categories are
 * termed classes. The instance is usually described by a vector of features,
 * which together constitute a description of all known characteristics of the
 * instance.
 * <p>
 * Classification normally refers to a supervised procedure, i.e. a procedure
 * that produces an inferred function to predict the output value of new
 * instances based on a training set of pairs consisting of an input object
 * and a desired output value. The inferred function is called a classifier
 * if the output is discrete or a regression function if the output is
 * continuous.

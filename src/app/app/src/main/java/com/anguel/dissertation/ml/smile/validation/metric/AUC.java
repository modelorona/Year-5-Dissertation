/**
 * The area under the curve (AUC). When using normalized units, the area under
 * the curve is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a
 * randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative
 * one (assuming 'positive' ranks higher than 'negative').
 * <p>
 * In statistics, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC), or ROC curve,
 * is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier
 * system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The curve is created by
 * plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR)
 * at various threshold settings.
 * <p>
 * AUC is quite noisy as a classification measure and has some other
 * significant problems in model comparison.
 * <p>
 * We calculate AUC based on Mann-Whitney U test
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann-Whitney_U_test).

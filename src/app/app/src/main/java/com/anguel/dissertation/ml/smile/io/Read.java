     * Reads an ARFF file. Weka ARFF (attribute relation file format) is an ASCII
     * text file format that is essentially a CSV file with a header that describes
     * the meta-data. ARFF was developed for use in the Weka machine learning
     * software.
     * <p>
     * A dataset is firstly described, beginning with the name of the dataset
     * (or the relation in ARFF terminology). Each of the variables (or attribute
     * in ARFF terminology) used to describe the observations is then identified,
     * together with their data type, each definition on a single line.
     * The actual observations are then listed, each on a single line, with fields
     * separated by commas, much like a CSV file.
     * <p>
     * Missing values in an ARFF dataset are identified using the question mark '?'.
     * <p>
     * Comments can be included in the file, introduced at the beginning of a line
     * with a '%', whereby the remainder of the line is ignored.
     * <p>
     * A significant advantage of the ARFF data file over the CSV data file is
     * the meta data information.
     * <p>
     * Also, the ability to include comments ensure we can record extra information
     * about the data set, including how it was derived, where it came from, and
     * how it might be cited.
     *
     * @param path    the input file path.
     * @param context android context
     * @return the data frame.
     * @throws IOException        when fails to read the file.
     * @throws ParseException     when fails to parse the file.
     * @throws URISyntaxException when the file path syntax is wrong.

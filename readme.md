This repo contains the Android application. The submodules contain the WebRTC signalling server and Firebase functions.

The SMILE library was modified slightly to change the code that was for java 8+ so it could work with Android. It was originally included as a gradle dependency however there were some build errors that could not be figured out and it was quicker to strip it down and modify slightly as needed. All rights go to the original author and library [here](https://github.com/haifengl/smile).
